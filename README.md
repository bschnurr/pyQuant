In the U.S. stock market, many healthy and mature companies pay cash to its shareholders as dividend every certain period. Periods can be monthly, quarterly or every 6 months or every year. The good thing is investors who own shares of those companies don't have to do anything to collect periodic dividends. Cash payments just deposit directly to shareholders' accounts. All shareholders have to do to collect dividends is just buy and hold the shares of the company which pay out dividends. As shareholders, we can do whatever we want with the dividends. we can pay monthly expenses like phone bills or rents, go shopping to buy whatever we want or buy more shares to collect more dividends later.

Dividend is one of the equity factors which generate extra alpha returns, and investing in the stocks which pay dividends to their shareholders can collect extra returns.

## Considering Factors
- **Dividend Factors**: Dividend Yield, Dividend Growth
- **Fundamental Factors**: Earnings, ROE, Balance Sheet Ratios
- **Momentum Factor**: used to determine current market direction (negative momentum -> downtrend, positive momentum -> uptrend)
